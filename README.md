IoT Meteo Station with Arduino
# Weather Station Construction

This repository contains the documentation and code for the construction of a weather station. The purpose of this project is to measure and record weather phenomena in the microclimate, including temperature (in Celsius or Fahrenheit), humidity, atmospheric pressure, brightness, and wind speed (as examples). The measured values will be graphically displayed in real-time and can be applied in various fields, such as fire prevention, precision agriculture in greenhouses, and intelligent control of climate systems.

## Components

The weather station consists of the following components:

1. Temperature sensor
2. Humidity sensor
3. Atmospheric pressure sensor
4. Brightness sensor
5. Wind speed sensor

## Data Display

The measured values will be displayed graphically and in real-time. The data will be continuously updated and presented in a user-friendly format.

## Applications

The weather station can be used in various domains, including:

- Fire prevention: Monitoring weather conditions to prevent and predict wildfires.
- Precision agriculture: Optimizing greenhouse conditions for crop growth.
- Intelligent climate control: Adjusting climate systems based on real-time weather data.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `docs/`: Documentation files and user manual.
- `src/`: Source code for data collection and display.
- `hardware/`: Information about the hardware components used in the weather station.
- `examples/`: Examples and sample data.
